# Homework due on 22/08/2020

1. Request access and DM Valeriu to let him know about your request, then clone this repository using HTTPS
2. Open the project located at "2020.08.09-Day2/library" in IntelliJ IDEA
3. Checkout on a different branch (using git). Don't forget to fetch and pull first. The branch name should be sugestive, briefly telling about the feature it will contain.
4. Find your name below and solve the given task. Caution: Each task can be solved in 30 minutes tops. (During class we did it in 10) \
**Cristian Pop** - Given a String `keyword`, I want to receive all the books that contain that keyword from the library \
**Andra Ștefana Livadaru** - I want to be able to delete all the books from the library. \
**Mihail Mădălin Constantinescu** - Given a `Genre`, I want to receive all the books of that genre from the library \
**Ovidiu-Andrei Burduja** - On book save, validate that the `ISBN`, `author` and `author name` fields are not null. A custom exception should be thrown if those fields are null. \
**George Ionuț** Sabie - Given an ISBN, I want to receive the Book with that ISBN from the library \
**Cezar Diac** - On book save, validate that the `genre` and the `title` fields are not null. A custom exception should be thrown if those fields are null. \
**Bosac Ionut** - Given an ISBN, I want to receive a `true` if there is a book with that ISBN in the library or `false` otherwise
5. Push (to remote) your code onto the feature branch you created on item no. 3 
6. Go on Gitlab and create a **pull (merge) request** with Valeriu Moise as asignee \
7. If there are conflicts, solve them by merging the `master` branch into your `feature branch` and push the code again 

Have fun !
